\title{Calculate the numerator in the estimator Yhat.}
\usage{
CalcNumerator(Ai_j, Xi_j, gamma_numer, alpha, re_alpha, include_alpha = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{Ai_j}{A vector of length n_i - 1 including the treatment assignment of
all but the unit we are currently considering.}

\item{Xi_j}{The matrix of covariates for all units in the cluster but the
one. This can be the observed values or a counterfactual set of covariates.}

\item{gamma_numer}{A vector of the numerator coefficients starting with the
intercept.}

\item{alpha}{The average probability of treatment among the n_i - 1 units.}

\item{re_alpha}{The fixed effect bi that gives average propensity of
treatment in the group equal to alpha.}

\item{include_alpha}{If include_alpha is set to true, the probabilities in
the numerator are divided by the specified value of alpha to stabilize the
calculation. Defaults to TRUE.}
