\title{Estimates and asymptotic variance of the population average potential
outcome for known or estimated propensity score model.}
\usage{
Ypop(
  ygroup,
  ps = c("true", "estimated"),
  scores = NULL,
  dta = NULL,
  use = "everything"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ygroup}{An array including the group average potential outcome
estimates where the dimensions correspond to group, individual treatment and
value of alpha.}

\item{ps}{String. Can take values 'true', or 'estimated' for known or
estimated propensity score. Defaults to 'true'.}

\item{scores}{A matrix with rows corresponding to the parameters of the
propensity score model and columns for groups. Includes the score of the
propensity score evaluated for the variables of each group. Can be left NULL
when ps is set to 'true'.}

\item{dta}{The data set including the variable neigh. Defaults to NULL. Can
be left NULL when the true propensity score is used.}

\item{use}{Whether the data with missing values will be used for the
estimation of the variance. Argument for cov() function. Defaults to
'everything'.}
